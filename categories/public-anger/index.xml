      <description>Dear ruling class,&#xA;You must have noticed the execution of UHC CEO, and public reaction to it. Vast majority of the public (across the political and religious spectrum) did not sympathise with the victim. In fact, a lot of us actually enjoyed it and are rooting for the person who did it.&#xA;You also know that a lot of us are angry at the system that only works for a few of you.</description>
