    <p>Dear ruling class,</p>
<p>You must have noticed the execution of UHC CEO, and public reaction to it. Vast majority of the public (across the political and religious spectrum) did not sympathise with the victim. In fact, a lot of us actually enjoyed it and are rooting for the person who did it.</p>
<p>You also know that a lot of us are angry at the system that only works for a few of you. In case you weren&rsquo;t convinced yet, the public reaction to UHC CEO execution should be proof that people are angry at the ruling class.</p>
<p>So then where do we go from here?</p>
<p>You could keep the system the same, but focus on a <em>different problem</em> â€” like communication/perception/public-relation/narrative, or instill fear (try to set an example of the killer so nobody dares do this again). You could, and probably will, beef up your security,

<p>What do you think would be the endgame if the system doesn&rsquo;t improve for the general populace? Public anger will continue to increase and then at some point it would probably result in social unrest. You can only distract us with the political and cultural wars for so long. At some point, people are bound to awaken from these misdirections and find out that the puppet masters have been the problem all along. This could very well result in the equivalent of the French revolution, and that would be a <span class="sidenote">

<p>Listen to this anger, and change the system to work better for the general public! Keep your own greed in check and share more of the wealth-pie with workers! Realize that your greed is pushing the middle class into the poor class. Self regulate your greed (as a lot of you like to promise) while you still have the time to do so, or else you will be regulated one way or the other! Focus on solving the core problem, and don&rsquo;t <em>just</em> focus on  <span class="sidenote">

    ><span>hello</span></a>! I (author of this blog) am not in any way affiliated/involved with the person who executed the UHC CEO. I&rsquo;m just a frustrated worker who wants the pendulum to swing back to a more balanced position &ndash; one where the general populace does not have to be this frustrated with the system! You might be wondering why the anonymity then? Because I don&rsquo;t want to get dragged into culture wars. This specific note is deep-linkable so that you could easily share it and save your agency&rsquo;s resources :)</p>

<p>I know that not <em>all</em> people in the ruling class are bad. There are few people that have tried to call attention to this anger and tried to propose some changes. If you are one of them, please spend more of your time, energy and money on solving this issue. Publicly shame your ruling class fellows who are hell bent on keeping more of the wealth pie for themselves. And if you&rsquo;re thinking, well you will just donate to some charities and feel good about yourself &ndash; then that just is not going to be enough!
